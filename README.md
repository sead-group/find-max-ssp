# find-max-ssp
Logic to find the maximum Steady State Performability scenario.

This repository may evolve over time, but instructions will be maintained to reproduce any results referenced in the paper.

Running the main function will print the best SSP and the relevant 'combination' of states (and their respective traffic distributions)

Changing the "simple_mode" value from True to False (in main.py) will brute force the full set of combinations. This will take several DAYS of run-time.
